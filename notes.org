* k8s sim
  1. kubectl create pod - just create containers (which are connected via flannel)
     1. Specify label for services
     2. User specified node - simplified running of pods
  2. deployment?
  3. kubectl create service - create kubeproxy rules
     1. Want to give list of pods or use label selector based
  4. kubectl exec pod
  5. Multi-cluster - basic connectivity
* User interaction 
  1. Exec c1, ping c2.podip
  2. Exec c1, ping s2.vip (should go to c2) (nping)
  3. Exec c1, ping s3.vip (running on another cluster)
     1. VIP or service name? How does skupper manage?
  4. (optional) Show policy simulation
* Challenges
  1. Use flanneld with docker containers
  2. Run kubeproxy on single node on it's own
     1. Instead simulate using nft
  3. Coredns setup - maybe skip in interest of time/overheads
  4. Multi-clusters qpid dispatch router based routing
     1. Simulation of skupper
